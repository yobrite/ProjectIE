About Bikram Yoga River North
Inside a 2,000-square-foot room heated to 105 degrees, students practice the 26 poses of the Bikram Yoga series.

Though everyone performs the poses together, instructors who were directly trained and certified by the yoga style's founder—help participants modify the poses to their ability. Each posture works a specific part of the body, and the heat encourages flexibility and prompts sweating, which can expel toxins.

Whether before or after class, all students are welcome to use the studio's complete changing room and private shower facilities, which are part of Bikram Yoga River North's other 4,000 square feet, along with a large lobby.

Doors open 30 minutes before the start of class. Please bring your mat, bath-sized towel, and water for class. Locks are for sale or students may bring their own.
