Zumba: A Fitness Style on the Move
Zumba is one of the peppiest fitness options on the schedule. Read on to learn a little about where it comes from.

Because of its tendency to dissolve inhibitions by the time the beat sets in, Zumba has been deemed “exercise in disguise” by instructors in both The Huffington Post and USA Today. The dance-fitness program—now a mainstay in thousands of gyms worldwide—syncs basic dance steps and calisthenics to upbeat music, often drawing upon Latin styles such as merengue, salsa, and flamenco. Certified instructors demonstrate each piece of choreography at the front of the room, motivating participants to groove at their own pace and add creative flairs as they see fit. The program currently branches off into eight variations, including Zumba Gold for senior citizens, Zumbatomic for children, and Zumba Toning for exercisers who wish to incorporate strength-training elements.

Zumba got its start in Colombia in the mid-1990s, the brainchild of fitness instructor Alberto “Beto” Perez. According to Reuters, Beto initially wanted to name it Rumba—a Spanish word that can translate to party—but swapped in the Z when he found his first choice was trademarked. Today, Beto keeps up with the constantly changing musical culture by arranging new routines for his vast network of instructors every two months, incorporating newer styles such as hip-hop and reggaeton and enlisting artists such as Pitbull and Wyclef Jean to record Zumba-specific tracks.
