About Advanced Cryotherapy & Fitness
Advanced Cryotherapy & Fitness in River North wants its clients to look younger, feel better, and enhance their performances. That may seem like a difficult job, but the staff makes it possible with two services: fitness training and cryotherapy. Training includes personal and group sessions, and there's also a non evasive fat loss program that is based on the correlation between 12- site body fat storage and possible hormonal imbalances. Cryotherapy, on the other hand, supplements your weight loss by helping you burn an additional 400-600 calories a session, helps reduce inflammation, facilitates recovery, and increases the metabolism and collagen production.

Several variations of Cryotherapy are available. For Whole Body, a chamber that covers 90% of your body reaches a temperature of -200 to -240 degrees Fahrenheit, which gets the blood flowing and helps reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and increase mobility. Treatments are only 3 minutes, which means core temperatures stay at a normal level. Localized Therapy is used to reduce pain and inflammation on targeted areas, unlike the whole-body chamber. Temperatures are as low as -240 degrees Fahrenheit, and targeted treatments only last 5–10 minutes. Also available is the CryoFacial. This noninvasive, chemical-free facial uses cold therapy to reduce pores, decrease wrinkles, and stimulate collagen production. After the 10 to 12-minute treatment, blood vessels dilate and oxygenated blood increases.
