Difficulty: the runs range from the beginner-friendly powder of Daisy Run to the more challenging bend of the Badger Bowl to the black-diamond plunge of Screamin' Steven
Snow Tubing: a separate snow tubing area sends riders sliding through a 1,000-foot chute
Lessons: group, private, and kids' lessons are all available on-site; the Learn to Turn package treats first-timers to an intro class and outfits them with equipment and a daylong flex ticket
Equipment Rental: the ski shop provides all of the necessary gear for a day on the slopes, including skis, snowboards, poles, boots, and microscopes for comparing snowflakes
