About Fit-Results
With the tug of a resistance band, Fit-Results’ instructors initiate clients into their boot-camp or group training classes. The collaborative group environment naturally cultivates camaraderie—and encouragement from peers can go a long way when faced with lifting a medicine ball or pulling a weighted sled. The high-intensity interval training works most effectively when matched with other Fit-Results programs, such as meal planning or personal training.
