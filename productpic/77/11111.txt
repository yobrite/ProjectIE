$59 for a 30-minute in-office teeth-whitening treatment (a $199.99 value)
$99 for a 60-minute in-office teeth-whitening treatment (a $279.99 value)
During each painless treatment, preloaded trays filled with an enamel-safe, light-activated solution are inserted into the mouth. An optional cheek retractor exposes teeth to the light, which results in an even tone and whiter smile for up to 12 months.

About Smiling Bright
The teeth-whitening technicians at Smiling Bright help customers forge whiter smiles with professional-strength in-office and at-home treatments. Cool gray walls and rich, mulberry-toned ceilings envelop Smiling Bright's inviting interior, accented with undulating mirrors, a sleek leather sofa, and private, curtain-drawn treatment rooms. In-office sparkle sessions outfit chompers with a tray preloaded with clinical-strength whitening gel, after which an LED light activates peroxide molecules to coax out stains and nesting yellow finches obscuring the enamel. Smiling Bright's specialty at-home X Cell Erator whitening system comes equipped with the same powerful gel as the in-office treatments, along with a battery-operated whitening light, a list of tips and instructions, and a shade guide to assess how much teeth have improved and whether to ground them from after-school privileges.
